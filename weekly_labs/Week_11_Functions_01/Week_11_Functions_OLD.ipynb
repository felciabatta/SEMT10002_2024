    "So far in this course, you've seen:\n",
    "* How to read, process, and store data as either a variable (*eg* as an `Integer` or `String`) or in a data structure (*ie* `List`, `Dictionary` of `Tuple`).\n",
    "* How to control the sequence of operations in your code with branching (*ie* if-then-else statements) or iteration (*ie* loops).\n",
    "* How to read and write from files.\n",
    "* How to plot data with matplotlib.\n",

    "Today, we will look at how we can group our code into functions to reduce repetition of code and to improve readability.\n",
